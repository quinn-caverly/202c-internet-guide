      <h2>General Practice Problems</h2>
      <p>
        "Advent of Code" is an annual online event where participants are
        challenged with daily coding problems from December 1st through the
        25th. Each dayâ€™s problems are designed to test a variety of programming
        skills and concepts, making them ideal for learning a new programming
        language. Although the problems are holiday-themed and are released
        during the holiday season, they can be accessed and solved any time of
        the year, thanks to the availability of problems from previous years on
        the site.

        <h3>Content and Scope</h3>
        <p>
          The problems span a wide range of programming concepts and vary in
          difficulty, starting with relatively easy challenges at the beginning
          of the month and culminating in very difficult ones at the end. Each
          problem is accompanied by a narrative that helps connect the coding
          challenges to real-life programming scenarios.
        </p>
        <h3>Relevance and Utility</h3>
        <p>
          These practice problems are valuable for both newcomers and
          experienced Rust programmers. Many users return year after year to
          solve new problems, proving the event's lasting appeal to seasoned
          developers. However, they are particularly beneficial for newcomers
          because they offer an opportunity to dynamically apply the concepts
          and language rules learned from the Rust Book and Rust by Example
          (RBE) to practical problems. This hands-on experience helps learners
          transition from merely understanding theoretical concepts to becoming
          proficient in writing Rust code that solves real-world problems and
          builds functional programs.

        <h3>Effective Use Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Start with the Basics: </strong>
            When learning a language, it's often wise to start by tackling the
            easier problems available at the beginning of each set, before
            progressing to more complex challenges.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Read Community Solutions: </strong>
            After completing a problem, explore solutions posted by other Rust
            users on platforms like Reddit or GitHub. This can provide valuable
            insights into creative problem-solving techniques.
          </li>

            <strong>Reference Generative AI: </strong>
            If you find yourself stuck on a problem, consider consulting a
            generative AI chatbot for a tailored explanation of specific Rust
            concepts.
